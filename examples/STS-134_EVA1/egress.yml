  # EV1's step "open thermal cover" should really drive the IV's step to start a
  # clock. The steps below show the YAML equivalent to the STS-134 procedure.

  # Minimal formatting: Below I do '''BLANK''' to bold the words. This is
  # MediaWiki (e.g. Wikipedia) syntax for bolding. People are generally familiar
  # with this syntax in our organization, so it's preferable. It's also probably
  # a lot harder to find an existing library that does this, whereas finding one
  # that does Markdown formatting is probably easy. So: do MediaWiki if you can,
  # but Markdown is fine as long as you make it fairly easy to drop in a
  # MediaWiki formatter in place later.

  # This corresponds to page 7-20, EV1 step 12 and EV2 step 8. I've re-written

    - step: Translate forward along Lab.
    # "HR" means "handrail". At some point in the future it may be cool to use
    # some sort of template here like: "on Lab HR {{HR|0260}}, {{HR|0259}} ..."
    # that allows us to generate links to our CAD/VR model of the space station.
    # This way people who are reading along and thinking "where is HR 0260" can
    # just click a link and see in the model (assuming they're viewing in an
    # HTML, not printed, version).

    EV2:
    - step: Close hatch thermal cover
    # best here would be to add IV's step using "causes".
